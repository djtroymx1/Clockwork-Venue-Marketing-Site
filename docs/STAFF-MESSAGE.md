# Clockwork Venue cutover — what you need to know

**TL;DR:** The software and website now live at **clockworkvenue.com**. Old links auto-forward. Please update bookmarks and (if you had the old icon) re-add the Console app icon.

## What changed
- **New website:** https://www.clockworkvenue.com  
- **Console:** https://console.clockworkvenue.com  
- Old links like **stageflowlive.com** automatically forward to the new site.

## Do I need to sign in again?
Maybe once. Because the domain changed, your browser may ask for a fresh login the first time. That’s normal.

## Update your bookmarks
- Replace any “Stageflow” bookmarks with **console.clockworkvenue.com** for the app.

## (Optional) Re-add the Console icon to your home screen
**iPhone/iPad (Safari)**
1) Open https://console.clockworkvenue.com  
2) Share → “Add to Home Screen” → **Add**

**Android (Chrome)**
1) Open https://console.clockworkvenue.com  
2) Menu (⋮) → “Add to Home screen” → **Add**

## Nothing else changes
All modules and screens work the same. If something looks off, let a manager know.
